    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This pizza uses hummus instead of the usual red sauce—a unique and healthy
      pizza for those bored with the traditional. Top with your favorite veggies
      and cheese. This recipe is from the book "The Complete Vegetarian
      Cookbook." It is a great way to use up leftover hummus. If you don't have
      any, you can use store-bought hummus. You can also use any kind of cheese
      you like, including vegan cheese.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        Roll out pizza crust and place on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Spread a
